# ANN-Bank
Use of ANN to predict potential bank leavers
We will be using Artificial Neural Networks to predict the potential bank leavers. For that, we have dataset of around 10000 people with the attributes including their Nation, Age, Credit Score, Bank Balance, Estimated salary etcetra. So using this we will be using artificial neural network with 11 input layer dimension, 2 hidden layers(of dimensions 6 each) and output layer(with dimension 1) that returns the probability of the person to leave the bank.

We will be using Rectifier activation function for the Hidden layers and Sigmoid activation function for the output layer.
